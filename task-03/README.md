**Instructions**

From your knowledge of PHP forms and files, PHP loops, functions and sessions, create a basic authentication page that does the following:

- register (a new user can register, their details stored in a database file).
- login (checks in the file and logs them in if they are already registered)
- reset password
- logout

NOTE: Storing details in a Database file means that the data you get from your user inputs should be stored in a file (i.e you are to use a file as your database, as opposed to using query languages)

**Submission**

To submit this task;

- create a repository on your github profile
- push your work to this repository
- submit the link to your repo

You will be graded on these 4 features. You get 2 marks each for each feature that works. Extra 2 marks for your overall code, the process and procedure.

GOOD LUCK!!!

 I completed the task. Facing a particularly nasty bug of the script failing to write to the file system when called via the browser on my local machine. Every thing works alright if I call it from the terminal though. And it also worked alright when run on replit.com

 Since the deadline has been extended, I'll try to spend some time fixing that bug. And I also want to confirm that the task should be submitted to a "new" repo.

 If that's the case, I'll have to do something about the hardcoded URLs I used, some manual labour.. or not

 Either way, I'm going to bed
